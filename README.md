## Introduction

`DenserNet` uses multiple-semantics fusion for image-based localization (as shown in the above figure), which leverages the image-level supervision (positive and negative image pairs) without feature correspondences. This repo is the PyTorch implementation of AAAI2021 paper "DenserNet: Weakly Supervised Visual Localization Using Multi-scale Feature Aggregation."
